Ideas:
- maybe just put everything in the same window, except things like "Can I sneak attack?" which can be quick pop-ups.
    - ON SECOND THOUGHT, maybe still have a popup to fill out the information and submit the roll, but print in main window
    - print with roll type and results laid out in a somewhat more readable format
- insight checks

THINGS THAT AFFECT ROLLS:
"Conditions":
- adv -> roll twice and take best (extra roll)
- guidance -> + 1d4 (rolled value)
- disadv
